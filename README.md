# Kayak Take Home SQL Exercise

## Assignment description

Using the data sets provided here https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays please provide
the DDL necessary to create tables for storing the 3 data sets.


Assuming youâ€™ve loaded the data into 3 tables, please write SQL to answer following questions:
* Busiest day of the week
* Busiest airport
* Busiest state (most flights with either an origin or destination in the state)
* Busiest state (most flights with both an origin and destination in the state)

## Infraestructure requirements:
* Docker;
* Docker-Compose;

## Lifting the infraestructure:
The local infrastructure is a MySQL Server and a connected web admin.

To start the services run ```docker-compose up```.

When you start the services using the above command the following happens:
* tables are created;
* the data inserted into db;
* views with the query answers of each exercise are created.

## Shuting down the infraestrucure:
To shut down the infraestructure run ```docker-compose down```

## Running the exercices SQLs:
It's possible to run the exercises SQLs using the Admin or inside the MySQL container.

### Using the Admin:

With the admin is possible to do some exploration in the tables (but you probably would be better of using Workbench);
* Access http://localhost:8080 username root password example;
* Click into "SQL command";
* Copy and Run the desired SQL Query;

### Using the MySQL container:
* Get inside the container ```docker exec -it kayak-airports-sql_db_1 bash```;
* Run ```mysql -uroot -p domestic_flights```;
* Copy and Run the desired SQL query;

### SQL Queries for each exercise:
* Busiest day of the week = ```busiest_day_of_the_week.sql```
* Busiest airport = ```busiest_airport.sql```
* Busiest state (most flights with either an origin or destination in the state) = ```busiest_state.sql```
* Busiest state (most flights with both an origin and destination in the state) = ```busiest_state_regional_flights.sql```

### Using the Materialized Views:
In my enviroment using Docker some queries are taking to long, so I've created Materialized Views (tables with the query result) when the services are started;
Views for each exercise:
* Busiest day of the week = ```busiest_day_of_the_week_mv```
* Busiest airport = ```busiest_airport_mv```
* Busiest state (most flights with either an origin or destination in the state) = ```busiest_state_mv_```
* Busiest state (most flights with both an origin and destination in the state) = ```busiest_state_regional_flights_mv```
